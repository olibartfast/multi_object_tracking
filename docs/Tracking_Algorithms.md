## 1. SORT (Simple Online and Realtime Tracking) {#sort}

**Characteristics**:
- Minimal and fast approach
- Based on Kalman Filter for prediction
- Association via Hungarian Algorithm with IoU
- Ideal for real-time applications

**C++ Implementation**:
```cpp
class Sort {
private:
    unsigned int max_age;
    int min_hits;
    double iouThreshold;
    std::vector<KalmanTracker> trackers;
    
public:
    std::vector<TrackingBox> update(const std::vector<TrackingBox>& detections);
};
```

### Algorithm Overview

SORT follows a straightforward tracking-by-detection approach:

1. **Prediction Phase**: Predicts track positions using constant velocity Kalman Filter
2. **Association Phase**: Associates detections to existing tracks using IoU and Hungarian algorithm
3. **Update Phase**: Updates track states with matched detections
4. **Management Phase**: Creates new tracks for unmatched detections, removes old tracks

### Key Components

- **Kalman Filter**: Uses 7-dimensional state vector (position, scale, aspect ratio, velocities)
- **Hungarian Algorithm**: Solves optimal assignment problem for detection-track matching
- **IoU Matching**: Primary similarity metric for association decisions
- **Track Lifecycle**: Simple age-based track management with hit/miss counters

### Technical Approach

- **State Representation**: Center coordinates, scale, aspect ratio, and their velocities
- **Motion Model**: Assumes constant velocity with Gaussian noise
- **Association Strategy**: Maximum IoU matching with configurable threshold
- **Track Initialization**: Immediate track creation for unassociated detections

### Advantages
- **High speed**: 100+ FPS on modern hardware
- **Implementation simplicity**: Minimal code complexity
- **Low computational requirements**: Suitable for resource-constrained environments
- **Proven reliability**: Widely tested baseline

### Limitations
- **No Re-ID handling**: No appearance features for robust association
- **Problematic with long occlusions**: Cannot recover tracks after extended disappearance
- **Frequent ID switches**: In complex scenes with similar objects
- **Pure motion model**: Relies only on motion prediction, vulnerable to erratic movements

- **Secondary Matching**: Low-confidence detections with lost tracks (appearance-based)
- **Tertiary Recovery**: Long-term re-identification for extended occlusions

### Tracking Pipeline

1. **Feature Extraction**: Extract Re-ID features for each detection
2. **Motion Prediction**: Kalman Filter prediction with GMC compensation
3. **Multi-stage Association**:
   - High-confidence detections with tracked tracks (IoU + appearance)
   - Low-confidence detections with lost tracks (appearance-based)
   - Remaining detections create new tracks
4. **Track Management**: Update states, handle track lifecycle

### Re-identification Module

**Feature Extraction**:
```cpp
FeatureVector BoTSORT::_extract_features(const cv::Mat& frame,
                                        const cv::Rect_<float>& bbox_tlwh) {
    // Crop detection region
    cv::Rect roi = bbox_to_rect(bbox_tlwh);
    cv::Mat crop = frame(roi);
    
    // Preprocess for ReID model
    cv::Mat input = preprocess_reid(crop);
    
    // ONNX inference
    auto features = reid_model->inference(input);
    return features;
}
```

**Appearance Distance Calculation**:
```cpp
float appearance_distance(const FeatureVector& feat1, const FeatureVector& feat2) {
    // Cosine similarity
    float dot_product = feat1.dot(feat2);
    float norm1 = feat1.norm();
    float norm2 = feat2.norm();
    return 1.0f - (dot_product / (norm1 * norm2));
}
```

### Advanced Features

#### Track State Management
```cpp
void Track::mark_lost() { state = TrackState::Lost; }
void Track::mark_long_lost() { state = TrackState::LongLost; }
void Track::mark_removed() { state = TrackState::Removed; }

// Automatic state transitions based on track age
if (time_since_update > max_time_lost) {
    mark_long_lost();
}
```

#### Class ID Management
```cpp
void Track::_update_class_id(uint8_t class_id, float score) {
    _class_hist.push_back({class_id, score});
    
    // Keep history size limited
    if (_class_hist.size() > max_class_history) {
        _class_hist.erase(_class_hist.begin());
    }
    
    // Update class based on weighted frequency
    std::map<uint8_t, float> class_weights;
    for (const auto& entry : _class_hist) {
        class_weights[entry.first] += entry.second;
    }
    
    // Select class with highest weighted frequency
    auto best_class = std::max_element(class_weights.begin(), class_weights.end(),
        [](const auto& a, const auto& b) { return a.second < b.second; });
    
    _class_id = best_class->first;
}
```
